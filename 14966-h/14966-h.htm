    <h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

    <p>"A motor car repairer," says Mr. Justice BRAY, "is like a
    plumber. Once you get him into the house you cannot get him
    out."... Unless, of course, you show him a burst bath pipe,
    when he will immediately go out to fetch his mate.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>According to Herr WILDRUBE, a member of the Reichstag,
    Germans should "rejoice at the departure of Mr. GERARD and his
    pro-Entente espionage bureau." They have some rubes in the
    U.S.A., but nothing quite so wild as this.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>An historical film, called "The Discovery of Germany," is
    being exhibited widely through the Fatherland under the
    auspices of the Government. A further discovery of
    Germany&mdash;that she has been fatally misled by her
    rulers&mdash;has not at present received the approval of the
    Imperial House.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The German Army authorities have issued an urgent warning to
    the public not to discuss military matters. Their own
    communiqu&eacute;s are to be taken as a model of the right kind
    of reticence.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>An American film syndicate have overcome their difficulty in
    finding a man to take the place of CHARLIE CHAPLIN. They have
    decided to do without.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>In Vienna, so as not to infuriate the indigent poor, tables
    are no longer placed near the window of the dearer restaurants.
    Similar establishments in Germany for the same reason were long
    ago made sound-proof.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We note that German and Turkish diplomats have been engaged
    in conference for the purpose of drawing the two countries
    closer together. Any little pressure from outside (as on the
    Tigris and the Ancre) is doubtless welcome as contributing to
    this end.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"The right way to dissipate the submarine nightmare" is how
    a contemporary describes the new restrictions on imports. The
    embargo on tinned lobster should certainly have that
    effect.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A museum is to be established at Stuttgart "to interest the
    masses of the people in overseas Germans and their conditions
    of life." Several Foreign Governments, it is understood, have
    expressed their willingness to supply specimens in any
    reasonable quantity.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Lively satisfaction is being expressed among members of the
    younger set at the appointment of Mr. ALFRED BIGLAND, M.P., as
    Controller of Soap. They are now discussing a resolution
    calling for the abolition of nurse-maids, who are notorious for
    using soap to excess.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A Bill has been introduced into the House of Lords with the
    object of admitting women to practise as solicitors. The
    raising of the statutory fee for a consultation to 6<i>s.</i>
    8&frac34;<i>d.</i> is also under consideration.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>At Old Street Police Court a man charged with bigamy pleaded
    that when a child he had a fall which affected his head. It is
    not known why other bigamists do it.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>At Haweswater, Westmoreland, some sheep were recently dug
    out alive after being buried in a snow-drift forty days. It is
    thought that a morbid fear of being sold as New Zealand mutton
    caused the animals to make a supreme struggle for life.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A lady correspondent of <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> suggests
    that tradesmen should economise paper by ceasing to send out a
    separate expression of thanks with every receipted bill. A
    further economy is suggested by a hardened creditor, who
    advocates the abolition of the absurd custom of sending out a
    quarterly statement of "account rendered."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Beer bottles are now said to be worth more than the beer
    they contain, and apprehension is being felt lest the practice
    shall develop of giving away the contents to those who consent
    to return the empty bottles.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Difficulty having been found in replacing firemen called up
    for military service, the Hendon Council, it is rumoured, are
    requesting the residents not to have any conflagrations for the
    present at least.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Mr. JOHN INNS, of Stevenage, has just purchased the whole
    parish of Caldecote, Herts; but the report that he had to do
    this in order to obtain a pound of sugar proves incorrect.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>NOTICE.</h3>

    <p>In order to meet the national need for economy in the
    consumption of paper, the Proprietors of <i>Punch</i> are
    compelled to reduce the number of its pages, but propose that
    the amount of matter published in <i>Punch</i> shall by
    condensation and compression be maintained and even, it is
    hoped, increased.</p>

    <p>It is further necessary that means should be taken to
    restrict the circulation of <i>Punch</i>, and on and after
    March 14th its price will be Sixpence. The Proprietors believe
    that the public will prefer an increase of price to a reduction
    of matter.</p>

    <p>Readers are urged to place an order with their Newsagent for
    the regular delivery of copies, as <i>Punch</i> may otherwise
    be unobtainable, the shortage of paper making imperative the
    withdrawal from Newsagents of the "on-sale-or-return"
    privilege.</p>

    <p>In consequence of the increase in the price of <i>Punch</i>
    the period covered by subscriptions already paid direct to the
    <i>Punch</i> Office will have to be proportionately
    shortened.</p>

    <h3>A ROMANCE OF RATIONS.</h3>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Not like to like, but like in difference."</p>

            <p class="i16">"<i>The Princess.</i>"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>I have always misjudged Victorine&mdash;I admit it now with
    shame. While other girls have become engaged&mdash;and
    disengaged quite soon after&mdash;she has remained unattached
    and solitary. As I watched the disappointed suitors turn sadly
    away I put it down to pride and self-sufficiency, but I was
    wrong. I see now that she always had the situation well in
    hand.</p>

    <p>As for Algernon, he is the sort of man who writes sonnets to
    lilies and butterflies and the rosy-fingered dawn&mdash;this
    last from hearsay as he really knows nothing about it. He is
    prematurely bald and suffers from the grossest form of
    astigmatism, and I thought that no woman would ever love him. I
    never dreamt that Victorine had even noticed he was there.</p>

    <p>One day I heard that they were engaged. It was too hard for
    me to understand.</p>

    <p>On the third morning I went to see her.</p>

    <p>"Victorine," I said, "you have never loved before?"</p>

    <p>"Never," she assented softly.</p>

    <p>"Now, this man you have chosen&mdash;you do not care
    overmuch for lilies and butterflies and rosy-fingered
    dawns?"</p>

    <p>"Not overmuch," she admitted sadly.</p>

    <p>"Then what is it brings you together? What strange link of
    the spirit has been forged between you? To speak quite plainly,
    what do you see in him?"</p>

    <p>"Yesterday we lunched together, and two days before that he
    got here in time for breakfast."</p>

    <p>"And the engagement still holds?" I am no optimist.</p>

    <p>"Before that we dined. Yes, I do not exaggerate. It was my
    suggestion. One sees so much unhappiness now-a-days, and I
    wished to be quite sure we were suited to one another."</p>

    <p>"And you are convinced of the sincerity of the
    attachment?"</p>

    <p>"Why, I feel for him as Mother does for the knife-and-boot
    boy, and Uncle Stephen for the charlady. We cannot be
    separated. It would be monstrous."</p>

    <p>I ceased to be articulate. Victorine suddenly became
    radiant.</p>

    <p>"We must always be together&mdash;at any rate for the
    duration of the War, you see. I eat under my meat and he is
    over. In flour and sugar&mdash;oh, how can I confess
    it?&mdash;I <i>exceed</i>. He is far, far below his ration.
    Apart we are failures; together we are perfect. We both saw it
    at once."</p>

    <p>I realised suddenly the inevitability of this mutual
    bond.</p>

    <p>"So marriage is the only thing?" I asked; but I was already
    conquered.</p>

    <p>She assented with a regal air.</p>

    <p>As I went away I saw a new and strange beauty in the problem
    of Food Shortage.</p>

    <h3>MORE OR LESS.</h3>

    <p>The fleet of Dutch merchantmen which has been sunk by a
    waiting submarine sailed, it now appears, under a German
    guarantee of "relative security": and the incident has been
    received in Holland with a widespread outburst of relative
    acquiescence. Germany, in the little ingenious arrangements
    that she is so fond of making for the safety and comfort of her
    neighbours, is so often misunderstood. It should be obvious by
    this time that her attitude to International Law has always
    been one of approximate reverence. The shells with which she
    bombarded Rheims Cathedral were contingent shells, and the
    <i>Lusitania</i> was sunk by a relative torpedo.</p>

    <p>Neutrals all over the world who are smarting just now under
    a fresh manifestation of Germany's respective goodwill should
    try to realise before they take any action what is the precise
    situation of our chief enemy. He has (relatively) won the War;
    he has (virtually) broken the resistance of the Allies; he has
    (conditionally) ample supplies for his people; in particular,
    he is (morally) rich in potatoes. His finances at first sight
    appear to be pretty heavily involved, but that will soon be
    adjusted by (hypothetical) indemnities; he has enormous
    (proportional) reserves of men; he has (theoretically)
    blockaded Great Britain, and his final victory is
    (controvertibly) at hand.</p>

    <p>But his most impressive argument, which cannot fail to come
    home to hesitating Neutrals, is to be found in his latest
    exhibition of offensive power, namely, in his (putative)
    advance upon the Ancre.</p>

    <h2>THE SOLACE.</h2>

    <p>Mr. William Wood, grocer, of Acton, was very tired. And no
    wonder, for not only had he lost his two assistants, both
    having been called up, but the girls who had taken their places
    were frivolous and slow. Moreover his errand boy had that day
    given notice. And, furthermore, the submarine campaign was
    making it every day more difficult to keep up the stock, and
    the rise in prices meant anything but the commensurate increase
    of profit of which he was accused by indignant customers.</p>

    <p>Mr. Wood, therefore, was not sorry when, the shutters up, he
    could retire to his sitting-room upstairs and rest. His one
    hobby being reading, and his favourite form of literature being
    Lives and Letters, he had normally no difficulty in dismissing
    the shop from his mind. He would open the latest memoir from
    the library and lose himself in whatever society it
    reconstructed, political for choice. But to-night the solace
    could not so easily be found. For one thing, he had no new
    books; for another, the cares of business were too recent and
    too real.</p>

    <p>He sank into his armchair, covered his eyes with his hand,
    and pondered.</p>

    <p>Then suddenly he had an idea. If there were no letters of
    the Great to read, he would himself write to the Great and thus
    escape grocerdom and worry. If he were not a person of
    importance, he would at least pretend to be, and thus be
    comforted.</p>

    <p>Seating himself at the table and taking up his pen, he
    composed with infinite care the following chapter from a
    biography of himself:&mdash;</p>

    <p>The year 1916 was a comparatively uneventful one in the life
    of our hero. The principal events were the marriage of his
    youngest daughter with the son of the Bishop of Brighton and
    the rebuilding of The Towers after the fire. Perhaps the most
    important of his new friends were the Archbishop of CANTERBURY
    and Sir HEDWORTH MEUX, but unfortunately Sir HEDWORTH has not
    kept any of the letters. Nor is there much correspondence; but
    a few letters may be printed here, all testifying to the
    multifarious interests of this remarkable man, who not only
    knew everyone worth knowing, but projected himself into their
    careers with so much sympathy and keenness. The first is to the
    then Prime Minister:&mdash;</p>

    <p class="center"><i>To the Right Hon. H.H. ASQUITH,
    M.P.</i></p>

    <p>MY DEAR ASQUITH,&mdash;This is only a line to remind you
    that you lunch with me at the Primrose Club on Monday at one
    o'clock. I have asked two or three friends to meet you, all
    good fellows. With regard to that matter on which you were
    asking my advice, I think that the wisest course at present is
    (to use the phrase, now a little stale, which I invented for
    you) to wait and see. Let me say that I thought your speech at
    the Guildhall a fine effort. Kindly remember me to the wife and
    Miss ELIZABETH, and believe me,</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

            <p class="i4">WILLIAM WOOD.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>P.S.&mdash;I wish you would call me William. I always think
    of you as Herbert.</p>

    <p class="center"><i>To the Earl of ROSEBERY.</i></p>

    <p>MY DEAR ROSEBERY,&mdash;It is a great grief to me to have to
    decline your kind invite to Dalmeny, but there is an obstacle I
    cannot overcome. My youngest daughter is to be married next
    week to the son of the Bishop of Brighton, a most well-bred
    young fellow with perfect manners. Nothing but the necessity of
    my presence at the feast of Hymen could deprive me of the
    pleasure of seeing your country place. Do not stay away too
    long, I beg. The town is dull without you.</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>I am, dear ROSEBERY,</p>

            <p class="i4">Yours most affectionately,</p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <p class="center"><i>To Mr. RUDYARD KIPLING.</i></p>

    <p>MY DEAR KIPLING,&mdash;Just a line to say how much I admire
    your poem in this morning's <i>Times</i>. You have never voiced
    the feeling of the moment with more force or keener insight.
    But you will, I am sure, pardon me when I say that in the
    fifty-eighth stanza there is a regrettable flaw, which could
    however quickly be put right. To me, that fine appeal to Monaco
    to give up its neutrality is impaired by the use of the word
    "cope," which I have always understood should be avoided by
    good writers. "Deal" has the same meaning and is a truer word.
    You will, I am sure, agree with me in this criticism when you
    have leisure to think it over.</p>

    <p>Believe me, my dear KIPLING,</p>

    <div class="poem">

    <p class="center"><i>To His Grace the Archbishop of
    CANTERBURY.</i></p>

    <p>MY DEAR ARCHBISHOP,&mdash;That was a very delightful dinner
    you gave me last night, and I was glad to have the opportunity
    of meeting Lord MORLEY and discussing with him the character of
    MARLBOROUGH. While not agreeing with everything that Lord
    MORLEY said, I am bound to admit that his views impressed me.
    Some day soon you must bring her Ladyship down to The Towers
    for a dine and sleep.</p>

    <p class="center"><i>To Lord NORTHCLIFFE.</i></p>

    <p>MY DEAR ALFRED,&mdash;You cannot, I am sure, do better than
    continue in the course you have chosen. What England needs is a
    vigilant observer from without; and who, as I have so often
    told you, is better fitted for such a part than you? You have
    all the qualities&mdash;high mobility, the courage
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page153"
       id="page153"></a>[pg 153]</span> to abandon convictions, and
       extreme youth. If you lack anything it is perhaps ballast,
       and here I might help you. Ring me up at any time, day or
       night, and I will come to you, just as I used to do years
       ago when you were beginning.</p>

    you. I write now because it has occurred to me that the proper
    place for Lord Scudamore to disown his guilty wife and for her
    impassioned reply is not, as we had it, the spare room, but the

    <h2>THE WATCH DOGS.</h2>

    <p class="center">LVII.</p>

    <p>My Dear Charles,&mdash;St. John, in 1914 a light-hearted
    lieut., advancing and retiring with his platoon as an
    all-seeing Providence or a short-spoken Company Commander might
    direct, and in 1915 a Brass-hat with a vast amount of knowledge
    and only a hundred buff slips or so to write it down on, is now
    Second in Command of his regiment. He tells me he is encamped
    with his little lot on the forward slope of a muddy and much
    pitted ravine. On the opposite slope are some nasty noisy guns,
    and at the bottom of the ravine are the cookers.</p>

    <p>When, after much forethought, he has found something to do
    and has begun doing it, there is a cry of "Stand clear!" and,
    with that prudence which even an Englishman will learn if you
    do not hustle him but give him a year or two to find by
    experience that care should sometimes be taken, all get to
    earth. The guns fire; the neighbourhood heaves and readjusts
    itself, and a man may then come out again. By the time,
    however, he has collected his senses and his materials there is
    another "Stand clear!" and back he must go to earth. This is
    what is technically known as Rest.</p>

    <p>It was not good enough for one of the battalion cooks. No
    man can do justice to a mess of pottage by lying on his belly
    at a distance and frowning at it. After many movements to and
    fro, he eventually said be damned to guns and "Stand clears;"
    stood on the top of his cooker (there was nowhere else to
    stand), and, holding a dixie lid in his hand and bestowing on
    the contents of the dixie that encouraging smile without which
    no stew can stew, defied all the artillery of the B.E.F. to do
    its worst. It did.</p>

    <p>The cook recovered to find himself among his dixies,
    frizzling pleasantly and browning nicely in certain parts. Even
    so, professional interests over-came any feeling of personal
    injury. Rising majestically, he stepped down and advanced upon
    the nearest gun crew. "Now you've done it, you blighters!" he
    shouted, waving an angry fist at them. "You've been and gone
    and blown all the pork out of the beans."</p>

    <p>The same man went on holiday to the neighbouring town, which
    is in reality an ordinarily dull and dirty provincial place,
    but to the tired warrior is a haven of rest and a paradise of
    gaiety and good things. Here he came into contact with the
    local A.P.M. in the following way. The latter was in his office
    after lunch, brooding no doubt, when in came a French policeman
    greatly excited in French. There was, it appeared, promise of a
    commotion at the Hotel de Ville. A British soldier had got
    mixed up in the queue of honest French civilians who were
    waiting outside for the delivery of their legal papers. There
    were no bi-linguists present, but it had been made quite clear
    to the Britisher that he must go, and it had been made quite
    clear by the Britisher that he should stay. Always outside the
    Hotel de Ville at 2.30 of an afternoon was this queue of
    natives, each waiting his turn to be admitted to the joyless
    sanctum of the Commissaire, there to receive those illegible
    documents without which no French home is complete. Never
    before had a British soldier fallen in with them, and, when
    requested to dismiss, showed signs of being obstreperous.</p>

    <p>The A.P.M. buckled on his Sam Browne belt and prepared for
    the worst, which he assumed to be but another example of the
    frailty of human nature when suddenly confronted with
    unaccustomed luxuries. When he got to his prey he found him not
    quite in the state expected. Usually at the sight of an A.P.M.
    a soldier, whatever the strength of his case, will express
    regret, promise reform, and make ready to pass on. This one
    stood his ground; on no account would he leave the queue. He
    explained to the A.P.M. that he was too used to the manifold
    and subtle devices of people who wanted to snaffle other
    people's places in queues. He was however quite prepared to
    parley, and was only too glad to find a fellow-countryman,
    speaking the right language and having the right sense of
    justice, to parley with.</p>

    <p>He said he had taken his proper place in the line, with no
    attempt to hustle or jostle anyone else. He meant to do no one
    any harm, and he was prepared to pay the due price, in current
    French notes, whatever it might be. But having got his place by
    right he refused to give it up to anyone else, be he French or
    English, Field Officer or even gendarme. He had been
    excessively restrained in resisting the unscrupulous attempts
    of the gendarme to dislodge him. If he had made any threat of
    knocking the gendarme down he had not really intended to take
    that course. The threat was only a formal reply to the
    gendarme's proposal to stick a sword through his middle.</p>

    <p>He was, he said most emphatically, not drunk. If the A.P.M.,
    in whom he had all confidence, would occupy his place in the
    queue and keep it for him, he would demonstrate this by a
    practical test. In any case he ventured to insist on his point.
    Without claiming any special privileges for a man fighting and
    cooking for his country, he claimed the right of any human
    being, whatever his nationality, to witness any cinema show
    which might be in progress.</p>

    <p>The underlying good qualities of both nations were evidenced
    in the sequel. When the A.P.M. had interpreted the matter the
    gendarme insisted on an embrace, and the cook permitted it.
    Later, I have reason to believe, they witnessed a most moving
    cinema play together, but not in the Commissaire's office at
    the Hotel de Ville.</p>

    the barometer is very high."</p>

    <p>But no one listened to her.</p>

    <p>"The reason is," said the duck with the black wings, "that
    the pond is nearly empty. When the pond is empty it doesn't
    rain."</p>

    <p>"It's the hen-house," said the black hen. "Whenever the roof
    drips there is rain."</p>

    <p>"It is certainly the hen-house," said all the hens.</p>

    <p>"It comes from the trees," said the turkey. "The leaves drip
    and then there is rain, and the more they drip the heavier it
    rains."</p>

    <p>"It is my kennel," chuckled Bruno, the wise old dog. "The
    more it leaks the more it rains."</p>

    <p>At that very moment it began to rain in torrents.</p>

    <p>"The pond is full," quacked the ducks. "Look at the
    pond."</p>

    <p>"Oh, do look at the hen-house roof&mdash;dripping!" shrieked
    the hens.</p>

    <p>"The leaves&mdash;look at the leaves," gurgled the
    turkeys.</p>

    <p>"And my kennel leaks. I can feel it on my back," chuckled
    Bruno.</p>

    <p>"The barometer has gone down," said the guinea-fowl.</p>

    <p>But no one took any notice of her&mdash;quite properly.</p>

    of FERDIE. But it is rumoured that he is preparing to conform
    to the general movement of the Central Allied Powers, and is
    therefore taking a little gentle running exercise in the
    Vulpedrome at Vienna.</p>

    <p>"V.T.C."&mdash;We rejoice with you that already&mdash;not
    more than 2&frac12; years since the revival of the Volunteer
    Force&mdash;the War Office has recognised the desirability of
    giving the Volunteer a rifle to shoot with; and it now seems
    almost certain that he will receive one, <i>free of charge</i>,
    before the conclusion of peace. We welcome this wise and
    generous decision, for though we have never pretended to be a
    military authority we have always held the view that in a tight
    corner a man with a rifle has an appreciable advantage over an
    unarmed man.</p>

    <p>"FORTUNE-TELLER."&mdash;Like you, we are greatly impressed
    by the convincing arguments advanced by our military experts in
    support of the view that the Germans are likely to put forth a
    great effort this year at some point on one of their fronts;
    and we share your belief that the time has come when the
    Government should supply a long-felt want by establishing a
    Department of Intelligent Anticipation. It is a happy
    suggestion of yours to offer, for a reasonable consideration,
    to place at the disposal of such a Department your
    admirably-equipped premises in Bond Street.</p>

    their joy-peals now that the military authorities have
    commandeered the church bells. It was very bright of you to
    think of this. The answer is that, in view of pressing national
    needs, they are going to give up having victories. After all,

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <p><i>Monday, February 26th.</i>&mdash;The new Member for
    Roscommon has not yet appeared in the House, but he is
    nevertheless doing his bit more effectively, perhaps, than some
    of his compatriots. The SPEAKER'S ruling is "No seat, no
    salary"; so Count PLUNKETT will have the satisfaction of
    knowing that by his self-sacrificing absence he is paying the
    expenses of the War for at least five seconds.</p>

    <p>With suitable solemnity Sir EDWARD CARSON gave a brief
    account of the exploits of the German destroyer squadrons. One
    of them, comprising several vessels, had engaged a single
    British destroyer for several minutes before cleverly executing
    a strategic movement in the direction of the German coast;
    while another had simultaneously bombarded the strongholds of
    Broadstairs and Margate, completely demolishing two entire
    houses. The damage would have been still more serious but for
    the fortunate circumstance that the fortresses erected on the
    foreshore last summer by an army of youthful workpeople had
    been subsequently removed.</p>

    <p>Any gloom engendered by the fore-going announcement was
    quickly dissipated by Mr. BONAR LAW, who read a telegram from
    General MAUDE, announcing the fall of Kut-el-Amara.</p>

    <p>The rest of the afternoon was chiefly occupied by a further
    combat over the merits of Lord FISHER. Although, as Dr.
    MACNAMARA subsequently remarked, "this is not the time for
    fighting battles along the Whitehall front," I am afraid the
    House thoroughly enjoyed Sir HEDWORTH MEUX'S discursive account
    of his relations with the late FIRST SEA LORD, who really seems
    to be quite a forgiving person. At least it is not everybody
    who, after being greeted at a garden-party with "Come here, you
    wicked old sinner," would afterwards invite his accuser to
    lunch at the Ritz.</p>

    <p>In the first statement of policy made by Mr. LLOYD GEORGE
    after his appointment as Prime Minister he said that the
    primary step towards a settlement of an age-long Irish trouble
    would be the removal of the suspicion of Irishmen by Irishmen.
    Mr. DILLON'S notion of contributing to that desirable end is to
    accuse Sir BRYAN MAHON, who has had to deport certain
    recidivist Sinn Feiners, of being the tool of a Dublin Castle
    gang. Not, of course, that Mr. DILLON is in sympathy with Sinn
    Feiners; on the contrary he dislikes them so much that he would
    like to keep St. George's Channel between them and himself. But
    by his own speeches he has hypnotized himself into the belief
    that everything done by the British Government in Ireland must
    have a corrupt motive. His colleague from West Belfast is not
    much wiser, to judge by the tone of his speech to-night; and I
    think Mr. DUKE, who is doing his best to reconcile the
    irreconcilable, must have been tempted to adapt one of MR.
    DILLON'S phrases and to say that Ireland was between the DEVLIN
    and the deep sea.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, February 27.</i>&mdash;The capture of Kut has
    had an exhilarating effect upon Lord CREWE. Not long ago he was
    warning us against excessive jubilation over the British
    advance in that region. Now he justified his title by coming
    out as a regular <i>Chanticleer</i>, and invited Lord CURZON to
    tell the assembled Peers that we might be confident of
    regaining predominance in the whole of Mesopotamia.</p>

        </a> LORD BUCKMASTER'S DREAM OF A BRIGHTENED HOUSE OF
        LORDS.
    </div>

    <p>In these times the Lords can refuse nothing to the Ladies.
    In moving the second reading of a Bill to enable women to
    become solicitors Lord BUCKMASTER may have approached his
    subject in the spirit of a cautious knight-errant, as Lord
    SUMNER said, but he carried his argument. He owed something,
    perhaps, to the unintentional assistance of his opponents. Lord
    BUCKMASTER had incidentally mentioned that a woman once sat on
    the Woolsack, and there administered such very odd law that the
    City of London rose in mutiny. This shocked the historical
    sense of Lord HALSBURY, who hastened to point out that the lady
    in question had left the Woolsack for a reason entirely
    creditable to her sex, namely to become the mother of one of
    our greatest Kings. Then Lord FINLAY, who now occupies the seat
    alleged to have been filled by ELEANOR of Provence, endeavoured
    to frighten their Lordships by the thin end of the wedge
    argument. If women were admitted solicitors they would next
    want to practise at the Bar, and even become Judges. But the
    Peers refused to be intimidated, and gave the Bill a second
    reading.</p>

    <p>Mr. MACCALLUM SCOTT'S colossal intellect, like the
    elephant's trunk, can grapple with the most minute objects.
    Yesterday it was the shortage of sausage-skins; this afternoon
    it was the grievance of Scottish bee-keepers, who are deprived
    of sugar for their charges, and compelled to put up with
    medicated candy at twice the price. In spite of the FOOD
    CONTROLLER, I understand that MR. SCOTT has no intention of
    parting with the very promising swarm that he carries in his
    national headgear.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, February 28th.</i>&mdash;Mr. WATT was seized
    with a bright idea <span class="pagenum"><a name="page159"
       id="page159"></a>[pg 159]</span> this afternoon. The CHIEF
       SECRETARY FOR IRELAND had explained to Mr. GINNELL, that
       certain men had been convicted of having attempted to cause
       disaffection by singing disloyal songs. "Will the right hon.
       and learned gentleman give the House a sample?" interjected
       Mr. WATT. The notion of Mr. DUKE, <i>vir pietate gravis</i>,
       if ever there was one, indulging in ribald melody, caused
       much laughter, which was increased when the right hon.
       gentleman in his most portentous manner implied that his
       only reason for not granting the request was fear that the
       SPEAKER might intervene.</p>

        </a> SIR FREDERICK BANBURY AND COLONEL MARK LOCKWOOD
        CONSULT THE WATER LIST.
    </div>

    <p>A brief recrudescence of the MEUX-CHURCHILL duel was not
    much to the taste of the House, which is evidently of opinion
    that LORD FISHER might now be left alone both by foes and by
    friends. Members were glad to seek solace in the drink
    question, and gave a sympathetic hearing to the proposal of Mr.
    WING that they should voluntarily submit to the same restricted
    hours of consumption as they had imposed on the outside world.
    Mr. WING is a temperance reformer, but on this occasion he had
    the redoubtable assistance of Mr. GEORGE FABER, a stout friend
    of the "trade" whose hair had grown white, he declared (though
    in other respects he still looks delightfully juvenile), in
    fighting the Licensing Bill of 1908. In his opinion the House
    could no longer keep itself in a compartment
    apart&mdash;especially as it was not a watertight compartment.
    Sir FREDERICK BANBURY, who is naturally a champion of
    cakes&mdash;and ale&mdash;made a despairing effort to preserve
    the privileges of the Palace of Westminster, but did not carry
    his protest to a division; and after a few valedictory remarks
    from Colonel LOCKWOOD, including two quotations from LUCRETIUS
    (derived from a crib, as he modestly explained), the House
    unanimously decided that its habits should be in conformity
    with its debates&mdash;dry with moist intervals.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, March 1st.</i>&mdash;Copies of the unexpurgated
    edition of the Report of the Dardanelles Commission marked
    "confidential" are to be sent to the SPEAKER and to the leader
    of every political party in the House. If Mr. BONAR LAW thought
    by this announcement to allay curiosity he was disappointed.
    Requests for a definition of the term "political party" rained
    upon him from all quarters. It really is a rather nice point.
    Mr. ASQUITH, Mr. REDMOND and Mr. WARDLE will, of course,
    receive their copies of the <i>editio princeps</i>. But what
    about Mr. WILLIAM O'BRIEN, who commands a bare half-section,
    even if one includes Mr. T.M. HEALY as odd file? What, too, of
    the Peace-without-Victory party, which is all leaders? The case
    of Mr. PRINGLE and Mr. HOGGE, which was publicly mentioned,
    presents little difficulty. Much as they love one another,
    neither is prepared to acknowledge the other as his leader.</p>

    <p>The greatest crux is furnished by Mr. GINNELL and Mr.
    PEMBERTON-BILLING. Each of them leads a distinct party, making
    up by its activity and volubility for its comparative lack of
    size. Logically they may look forward to receiving copies of
    the "confidential" document too sacred for the inspection even
    of Peers and Privy Councillors. But I should not encourage them
    to hope.</p>

    <h2>PRIVILEGE.</h2>

    <p>Mr. Jenkins, junior partner in the firm of Baldwin and
    Jenkins, antique dealers, Wigpole Street, was in the habit, on
    fine afternoons, of walking home from business to his flat in
    the Brompton Road.</p>

    <p>He invariably chose the path which runs parallel to Park
    Lane, just inside the Park railings.</p>

    <p>Being middle-aged and unmarried he walked slowly and
    methodically, and was careful, when he came level with an
    entrance, to note the particular gates marked "In" and "Out."
    He would, as he crossed the "Out" opening, look sharply to the
    right, and as he passed the "In" opening look sharply to the
    left. "Safety first" was a creed with him.</p>

    <p>One mild Spring afternoon, as he was passing by an "Out"
    aperture, with his whole attention fixed to the right, he was
    aware, amid the sound of motor-horns and shouts, that the
    roadway had risen up and struck him on the back of the neck,
    and that something like the Marble Arch had kicked him at the
    same moment.</p>

    <p>A week later Mr. Jenkins recovered consciousness in a
    beautiful clean ward of St. George's Hospital. A smiling nurse
    stood by his bed and, as he tried to sit up, she told him he
    must be quiet and not disturb the bandages.</p>

    <p>"Your friend Mr. Baldwin is coming to see you to-day at two
    o'clock," she told him. "No, it is not serious; you are out of
    danger. Now you have only to be quiet; so when your friend
    comes you mustn't talk too much."</p>

    <p>He lay still and thought, and it all came back to him. "But,
    good heavens!" was his reflection, "that car must have come
    <i>in</i> by the '<i>Out</i>' gate! In that case," he
    continued, not without pleasure, "I can claim
    damages&mdash;very severe damages too."</p>

    <p>At two o'clock Mr. Baldwin, his grey-bearded friend and
    partner, entered. "Well, Jenkins," said he, "I'm glad to see
    you've turned the corner. You've had rather a narrow
    squeak."</p>

    <p>Mr. Jenkins looked at his friend for a moment. "Look here,"
    he said, "I'm not allowed to speak much, but did you know that
    that car, when it struck me, was coming in through an 'Out'
    gate, and, as that can be proved, don't you see that I can get
    pretty good compensation?"</p>

    <p>His friend's face remained solemn. "I fear not," he
    said.</p>

    <p>"But I must," said Jenkins. "It's as clear as can be. Scores
    of people must have seen it."</p>

    <p>Mr. Baldwin shook his head horizontally.</p>

    <p>"Heavy damages," said Mr. Jenkins, "I repeat."</p>

    <p>"I've gone into it," his partner replied, "and it's
    hopeless."</p>

    <p>"Why?" asked the sick man.</p>

    <p>"I'll tell you," said Mr. Baldwin. "Because that car
    belonged to the Duke of Mudcaster."</p>

    <p>"The more reason," said Mr. Jenkins, "for heavy damages.
    Very heavy. The Duke's rolling."</p>

    <p>"Maybe he rolls," said Mr. Baldwin. "But that is not all.
    Listen. The Duke of Mudcaster is the only representative of the
    Pennecuiks, whose founder had the good fortune to be of some
    service to KING WILLIAM III. For this service he and his
    posterity were allowed the privilege of entering places by
    gates marked 'Out' and leaving by gates marked 'In.'"</p>

    <p>Mr. Jenkins sat half up, groaned and subsided again. He said
    nothing.</p>

    <p>"Well, I must say good-bye now," said Mr. Baldwin. "Sorry
    I've depressed you about compensation, but you never had an
    earthly. See you again soon. So long."</p>

    <p>For some minutes Mr. Jenkins remained as one stunned. Then
    he began to think again. "I wonder," he said once or twice, for
    he knew his partner,&mdash;"I wonder. Could it have been
    Baldwin himself in his old Ford? Could it?"</p>

    <h2>HEART-TO-HEART TALKS.</h2>

    <p class="center">(<i>The German KAISER and a wounded Belgian
    Officer, a Prisoner.</i>)</p>

    <p><i>The Kaiser.</i> So, then, you are still in arms against
    me, still persisting in your insane desire for battle and
    bloodshed? Will nothing content you? Must you compel us to
    continue in our enmity when by a word peace might be
    established between us, and Belgium might take her place at the
    side of Germany as a sister-nation striving with us to promote
    the cause of true civilisation?</p>

    <p><i>The Belgian.</i> It is useless, Sir, to say such things
    to any Belgian.</p>

    <p><i>The Kaiser.</i> Why useless? Do you not wish that death
    and ruin and misery should cease?</p>

    <p><i>The Belgian.</i> Certainly we do. No one more ardently
    than the Belgians, for it was not we who desired war or began
    the contest. But when you talk of stopping we must remind you
    that it was by your deliberate choice that war was
    treacherously forced on us. What could we do except defend
    ourselves against the dastardly blow that you aimed at our
    life? And after that it was not by us that Louvain was
    destroyed, that old men and women and children were ruthlessly
    massacred. Do you think such scenes can be wiped out of the
    memory of a nation, so that her men shall turn round and kiss
    the bloodstained hand that has tried to throttle them? Surely
    you expect too much.</p>

    <p><i>The Kaiser.</i> You speak too freely. Remember in whose
    presence you are.</p>

    <p><i>The Belgian.</i> There is not much fear that I shall
    forget. I am in the presence of one who has desired at all
    costs to concentrate on himself the gaze of the world, caring
    nothing as to the means by which he accomplished his object.
    This man, for he is, after all, only a poor human creature
    prone to anger, suspicion and foolish jealousy&mdash;this man
    has always gone about arrogating to himself the attributes of a
    god, calling upon his own people to worship him, and on all
    other peoples to be humble before him. Stung by his own
    restless vanity and the servile applause of those who are ever
    ready to prostrate themselves before an Emperor, he has rushed
    hither and thither seeking to make others the mere foils of his
    splendour and his wisdom, making mischief wherever he went and
    striving to irritate and depress his neighbours. This man in
    peace was a bad neighbour, and in war a base and treacherous
    foe, sanctioning by his enthusiastic approval such deeds as the
    meanest villain would have contemplated with shame.</p>

    <p><i>The Kaiser.</i> This is too much. I gave you leave to
    speak, but not to revile me. You must not forget that you are
    in my power.</p>

    <p><i>The Belgian.</i> A noble threat! But it is right and
    proper that men like you, who think they are infallible because
    their cringing flatterers tell them so, should sometimes hear
    the truth. You dare, forsooth, to talk to a Belgian of your
    magnanimity and your desire for peace. Cannot you realise that
    our nation has been tempered by outrage and ruin; that exile
    and the ruthless breaking of their homes only serve to make its
    men and women more resolute; that even if others were to cease
    fighting against you, and if her sword were broken, Belgium
    would dash its hilt in your face till breath and life were
    driven out of her mangled body; that, in short, we hate you for
    your cruelty and despise you for your baseness; and that for
    the future, wherever there is a Belgian, there is one who is
    the enemy of the thing called KAISER.</p>

    <p><i>The Kaiser.</i> Enough, enough. I did not come here to be
    insulted. If you have suffered, you and your nation, it is
    because you have deserved to suffer for having dared to set
    yourself against Germany, whom our good old German god has
    appointed to lead the way in righteousness to the goal marked
    out for her.</p>

    <p><i>The Belgian.</i> Sir, when you speak like that you are no
    doubt a marvel in your own eyes, but to others you are a
    laughing-stock, a mere scare-crow dressed up to resemble a man,
    a thing of shreds and patches to whom for a time the
    inscrutable decrees of Providence have permitted a dreadful
    power. But we are resolute to endure to the end, and your
    blandishments will avail as little as your threats.</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned
    Clerks.</i>)</p>

    <p>It is strange to find the inexhaustible Mr. W.E. NORRIS
    turning towards the supernatural. Yet there is at least more
    than a flavouring of this in the composition of <i>Brown
    Amber</i> (HUTCHINSON), which partly concerns a remarkable
    bead, having the property of bringing good or evil luck to its
    various owners. As (after the manner of such things in stories)
    the charm was for ever being lost, and as the kind of fortune
    it conferred went in alternations, possession of it was rather
    in the nature of a gamble. All I have to observe about it is
    that such hazards consort somewhat better with the world of
    HANS ANDERSEN or the <i>Arabian Nights</i> than with those
    quiet and well-bred inhabitants of South-Western London whom
    one has learnt to associate with the name of NORRIS. Thus, in
    considering the nice problem of whether <i>Clement Drake</i>
    (as typical a Norrisian as ever buttoned spats) would or would
    not escape the entanglements of <i>Mrs. D'Esterre</i>, it
    simply irritated me to suppose that the event might be
    determined by the machinations of djins. In a word, East is
    East and S.W. is S.W., and never the twain shall, or should, be
    mixed up in a novel that pretends to anything more serious than
    burlesque. I am not sure also that, for different reasons, I
    did not regret the introduction of the War; though as a grand
    climax it has, I admit, a lure that must be almost irresistible
    to the novelist. For the rest, if you do not share my objection
    to the (dare I say it?) amberdexterity of the plot, you will
    find Mr. NORRIS as pleasant as ever in his scenes of
    drawing-room comedy.</p>

    <p>A volume of remarkable interest is <i>In Ruhleben</i> (HURST
    AND BLACKETT), into which Mr. DOUGLAS SLADEN has gathered a
    variety of information concerning the life of the English
    civilian prisoners in Germany, its many hardships and few
    ameliorations. The greater part of the book is filled with a
    series of letters sent by one of these prisoners to his mother.
    Perhaps (one suspects) the writer of these was not altogether
    an ordinary young man. From whatever reason, the fact remains
    that his letters are by no means uncheery reading; his books
    and study, most of all his friendships (with one fellow-captive
    especially), seem to have kept him contented and even happy. Of
    course some part of this may well have been coloured for the
    maternal eye; it is clear that he was greatly concerned that
    she should not be too anxious about him. A more impartial
    picture of the conditions at Ruhleben is given in the second
    part of the volume, and in a letter by Sir TIMOTHY EDEN,
    reprinted from <i>The Times</i>, on The Case for a wholesale
    Exchange of Civilian Prisoners. I should add that the book is
    illustrated with a number of drawings of Ruhleben made by Mr.
    STANLEY GRIMM, an artist of the Expressionist School (whatever
    that may mean). These are vigorous and arresting, if, to the
    unmodern eye, somewhat formless. But they are part of a record
    that all Englishmen can study with quickened sympathy and a
    great pride in the courage and resource of our race under
    conditions needlessly brutal at their worst, and never better
    than just endurable.</p>

    <p>Nothing will ever persuade me that <i>This Way Out</i>
    (METHUEN) is an attractive title for a novel, however
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page164"
       id="page164"></a>[pg 164]</span> effective it may be as a
       notice in a railway station. The book itself, however, is
       intriguing in spite of its gloominess. The grandfather of
       <i>Jane</i> and <i>John-Andrew Vaguener</i> committed a most
       cold-blooded murder&mdash;this in a prologue. Then, when we
       get to the real story, we find <i>Jane</i> tapping out
       popular fiction at an amazing pace, and her brother,
       <i>John-Andrew</i>, living on the proceeds thereof.
       <i>Jane</i> is noisy, vulgar, and successful in her own
       line, and gets on <i>John-Andrew's</i> nerves; and when he
       discovers that she has for once turned aside from tawdry
       fiction and written a play that is really good he decides
       that he can stand it and her no longer. While she was
       pouring out literary garbage he could just manage to endure
       his position, but the thought that she would be hailed as a
       genius while he remained an utter failure was the final
       stroke that turned him from a mendicant into a madman. I am
       not going to tell you exactly what happened, but <i>Jane</i>
       found a "way out," and with her departure from this life my
       interest in the book evaporated. Mrs. HENRY DUDENEY has
       notable gifts as a descriptive writer, and my only complaint
       against her is that vulgar <i>Jane</i> was not allowed to
       live, for in the Army or out of it she was worth a whole
       platoon of <i>John-Andrews</i>. The <i>Vagueners</i>, I may
       add, were not a little mad, but then they were Cornish, and
       novelists persist in treating Cornwall as if it were a
       delirious duchy.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>I don't think I can honourably recommend Mr. HUGH ELLIOT'S
    volume on <i>Herbert Spencer</i> (CONSTABLE) as light reading,
    though the ungodly may wax merry over the philosopher's first
    swear-word, at the age of thirty-six, in the matter of a
    tangled fishing-line, and may be kindled at the later picture
    of a middle-aged sportsman shinning, effectively too, after a
    Neapolitan who had pinched his opera-glasses. Fine human traits
    these in a character which will strike the normal man as
    bewilderingly unlike the general run of the species. The
    serious-flippant reader, tackling Mr. ELLIOT'S elaborate and
    acute analyses, may get an impression of an obstinate old
    apriorist, a sort of White Knight of Philosophyland, with all
    manner of reasoned-out "inventions" at his saddle-bow (labelled
    "Homogeneity-Heterogeneity," "Unknowable," "Ghost Theory,"
    "Presentative-Representative"), which don't seem, somehow, as
    helpful as their inventor assumes. And 'tis certain he took
    tosses into many of the pits of his dangerous deductive method.
    I don't present this as Mr. ELLIOT'S view. He is
    respectful-critical, and makes perhaps the best case for his
    old master's claim to greatness out of the assumption that
    SPENCER himself, stark enemy to authority and dogmatism, would
    have preferred his biographer's critical examination to any
    mere "master's-voice" reproduction of Spencerian doctrine. I
    wonder if he would!</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Miss F.E. MILLS YOUNG'S newest story has at least this much
    merit about it, that no one who has seen the title can complain
    thereafter of having been taken unawares by the course of the
    narrative. That is perhaps as well, for, having discovered in
    the opening chapters a sufficiently charming <i>Pamela</i>
    living in perpetual honeymoon with a partner rich, good-looking
    and with no particular occupation to interfere with unlimited
    motor trips and dinner parties, we might have imagined the tale
    was going to remain a jolly meaningless thing like that all
    through, and so have been as much shocked as the heroine
    herself on reading the fatal letter. But, since we knew the
    book to be called straight out <i>The Bigamist</i> (LANE), we
    could have no possible difficulty in foreseeing the emergence
    of that other wife from the buried past ready to pounce down on
    poor little <i>Pam</i> at her happiest. And of course she duly
    appeared. Not that such happiness could in any case have lasted
    long, for the man was, flatly, a cur, not deserving the notice
    of any of the rather foolish women he managed to
    attract&mdash;there were three of them&mdash;and not
    particularly worth your attention either for that matter.
    Having said so much I can gladly leave the rest to your
    perusal, or, better perhaps, your imagination, only hinting
    that the conclusion has something of dignity that does a little
    to redeem the volume. But when all is said this is not Miss
    YOUNG at her best, the characters without exception being
    unusually stilted, the plot unpleasant, and the South African
    atmosphere, for which I have gladly praised her before now, so
    negligible that but for an occasional name and a page or two of
    railway journey the yarn might as well have been placed in a
    suburb of London or Manchester as in the land of delectable
    sunshine.</p>

    <p>Mr. JOHN S. MARGERISON, in <i>The Sure Shield</i>
    (DUCKWORTH) sees to it that our national pride in our Fleet is
    thoroughly encouraged. Whether he is describing a race against
    the Germans in times of peace, or a fight against odds with
    them in these days of war, we always come out top dog. Very
    good. But, at the same time, I am bound to add that some of his
    stories compelled me to make considerable drafts on my reserves
    of credulity before I could swallow them. So improbable are the
    incidents in one or two of them that I am inclined to believe
    that they must be founded on fact. However that may be, their
    author is an expert in his subject, and writes with a vigour
    that is very bracing and infectious.</p>

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
